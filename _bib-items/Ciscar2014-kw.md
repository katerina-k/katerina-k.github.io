abstract: "Abstract From an engineering perspective, climate change can affect the energy sector in a number of ways, such as changes in the efficiency of power plants and increases in peak demand due to higher cooling demand in hotter summers. This article reviews how integrated assessment models have estimated the impacts of climate in the energy sector, including the modelling of adaptation. While most of the literature has considered changes in space heating and cooling demand, few models have studied the impacts on the supply side of the energy sector. The article also reviews the main findings of the related literature. A number of knowledge gaps and possible research priorities are identified. Modelling possible adaptation measures and assessing the effects of climate extremes on the energy infrastructure are topics that require further attention."
