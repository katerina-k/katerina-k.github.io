The goal of this research program is to build a next generation integrated suite of science-driven modeling and analytic capabilities, and a more expanded and connected community of practice, for analyses of the stressors, impacts, adaptations and vulnerabilities of global and regional change, with emphasis in understanding the Energy-Water-Land Nexus and interdependent infrastructures. Although the scope spans many complex facets of data, modeling, and analysis, as well as scales appropriate for integrated impacts and adaptation research, a particular focus of this effort is the development of multi- model, multi-scale capabilities spanning the domain of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs); Impact, Adaptation, and Vulnerability (IAV) models; and Earth System Models (ESMs).

#### Project 1.1:Â Gridded modeling of the energy-water-land nexus
**Investigators**: Hertel (lead), Diffenbaugh, Frolking, Lammers, Schlenker, Webster 

Project 1.1 focuses on questions related to extreme climate events, their effects on the energy- water-land system, and adaptation options in the contiguous U.S. To address these questions, fine-scale spatial and temporal analysis of the EWL system is necessary in order to capture the frequency, intensity and impacts of extreme climate events, as well as to understand the infrastructure needs for adaptation to these events. Our approach involves coupling fine-scale process models (water balance, power system and agricultural impact models) with a simplified gridded economic model (SIMPLE) of the U.S.

#### Project 1.2: Capturing governance, institutional, and system constraints related to energy-water-land in an integrated IAV-IA modeling framework
**Investigators**:  Fisher-Vanden (Lead), Frolking, Lammers, Olmstead, Webster, Wrenn 

Project 1.2 focuses on understanding how governance, institutional and system constraints will affect regional economies under alternative climate change futures, and how relaxing these constraints and addressing market failures could alleviate these economic impacts. We will couple fine-scale process models (water balance and power system models) with a sectoral-detailed economic model focused on the Western U.S. and Texas which will act as the coordinating mechanism to facilitate the interlinkages between the fine-scale IAV models, with an emphasis on governance, institutional, and system constraints.

#### Project 1.3: Integrated assessment of climate change impact risk on the food-energy-water nexus
**Investigators**: Sue Wing (lead), Mansur 

Project 1.3 focuses on assessing, globally, the risks of cascading adverse impacts on the energy-water-land nexus posed by climate change. Addressing questions at this scale requires a different approach than in Projects 1.1 and 1.2 since direct coupling of detailed process models is typically not feasible at this scale. Therefore, we emphasize the building of large scale statistical and process emulators that can be directly incorporated into a global IAM.

#### Project 2.1: Improving the quality and ease of use of climate information 
**Investigators**: Nicholas (lead), Forest, Keller, Haran, Sriver, Reed 

The current representation of climate projections has made tremendous progress in the recent past, but these methods still face considerable challenges (Figure 1). For example, two largely open questions that we will address in this project (in collaboration with many others working on IAM/IAV analyses) are: (i) How skillful are current empirical-statistical downscaling tools in their representation of decision-relevant information (e.g., modes and tails of relevant probability density functions or the spatio-temporal correlation structure) on regional to local scales? (ii) What are the inherent trade-offs between downscaling and emulation strategies (e.g. statistical emulators based on observational data versus mechanistic/process emulators based on model ensembles) for generating climate information for IA and IAV? 

#### Project 2.2: How does an improved sampling of known uncertainties influence the tails of climate projections on decision-relevant spatial and temporal scales? 
**Investigators**: Keller (co-lead), Sriver (co-lead), Forest, Haran, Nicholas, Reed 
	One key issue relevant for IAM and IAV analysis is that the frequency, duration, and intensity of climate and weather extremes (such as extreme precipitation events, droughts, heat waves, floods, and severe weather outbreaks) are changing (Walsh, et al., 2014). One key scientific question we will address is what are the driving mechanisms and the projected magnitudes of future changes in extremes. Elucidating this question is crucial to developing sound adaptation and risk management strategies, particularly at local to regional scales. 

#### Project 2.3: Developing regional climate projection tools to incorporate high risk events into decision- tools 
**Investigators**: Forest (lead), Keller, Reed, Sriver, Nicholas 

One limitation of current climate emulation methods is that global mean surface temperature is only one of several factors that may be relevant for changes in regional climates. It is well known that sea surface temperatures (both tropical and extra-tropical) drive large-scale teleconnection patterns that influence regional climate on seasonal and inter-annual time-scales. Primary examples are droughts over North America driven by El Nino or La Nina events which provide a tropical-wide forcing of the global climate system. Previous work (Tsai et al. 2014, Li and Forest 2014) has focused on developing statistical methods to emulate large-scale regional climate variability and change driven by such SST variability. Additionally, large-scale changes in patterns of snow cover, sea ice,and land cover are also known to drive large-scale atmospheric teleconnection responses influencing regional climate. However, the teleconnection characteristics (primarily, spatial and seasonal changes) of these other factors are expected to differ from those for SST-driven teleconnections such as ENSO. Driven by the combined regional and global scale response over the coming century, potentially high risk climate events such as those described above must be included in scenarios where regionally-resolved variability and change is important for careful IAV assessments.

<div class="subheader-3">Establishing best modeling practices, and developing evaluation tools for modeling frameworks via methods comparisons, diagnostics, and integrated uncertainty analyses</div>
<hr>

#### Project 3.1: Base research program for developing evaluation tools for modeling frameworks 
**Investigators**: Weyant (lead), Diffenbaugh, Lobell, Nicholas, Reed, Sue Wing 

Standards for model development and evaluation have been developed within a number of academic disciplines and application communities from earth sciences (PCMDI, 2016; Taylor, et al., 2012; Eyring, et al., 2015; Stouffer, et al., 2016) to operations research (Gass, 1983 &1993; Gass and Joel, 1987; Naylor and Finger, 1967) to computer science (Banks, et al., 1988; Kleijen, 1999; Kleindorfer and Gaeshan, 1993; Robinson, 2004; Sargent, 1981, 1984 & 2013) to economics (Wood, 1986; Boland, 2014) to ecology (Bachelet, et al., 2008); and from health systems (Denton, 2013) to energy systems (e.g., Hogan, et al., 1981; Weyant, et al., 2004 & 2006) to national security (National Research Council, 2006) to integrated assessment (Hamilton, et al., 2015; Kriegler, et al., 2015a&b; IAMC, 2016). Most, but not all, of this work has focused on single models developed within the boundaries of a single discipline without considering uncertainty in a systematic way. This work has been extremely valuable, but largely fragmented within and, especially, between these disciplines and application areas. Thus, for interdisciplinary IAV and IAM work there is a both a need and an opportunity to draw on this broad range of concepts and methods to develop multi-method, multi-disciplinary, multi-scale best modeling and model evaluation practices.

#### Project 3.2: Climate projections method intercomparison and model diagnostics 
**Investigators**: Reed (co-lead), Keller (co-lead), Fisher-Vanden, Forest, Haran, Mendelsohn, Nicholas, Sriver

Project 2.1 above proposes to analyze the impacts of improving climate information on climate stressors that have been chosen in collaboration with IAV and IAM experts a priori. This step can address several important questions, but it is silent on the potentially important (interactive) effects of other uncertainties and on the question of which (interacting) uncertainties matter the most (e.g., Butler, et al., 2014; Hadka et al., 2015; Lempert et al., 2012). Addressing these questions poses nontrivial diagnostic challenges. This work on climate model emulation and uncertainty characterization will help researchers improve the climate projections used in the integrated climate change impacts work described in work plan element I which is a major part of the model integration work in Program Element II. At the same time, it will extend and significantly deepen the climate system part of the overall diagnostics and uncertainty characterization program included in Program Element III.

#### Project 3.3: Quantifying the influence of global warming on unprecedented extreme climate events 
**Investigators**: Diffenbaugh (lead), Fisher-Vanden, Hartel, Sue Wing, Weyant

Effective climate risk management requires robust quantification of the probability of different kinds of hazards, such as heat waves, droughts, floods, and severe storms. Now that observed global warming has been clearly attributed to human activities, there is considerable interest in the extent to which that warming has influenced the occurrence and severity of individual extreme climate events. This interest is motived by a number of lines of evidence. First, extremes are where natural and human systems are often most acutely impacted by the climate system. Second, trends in the frequency and/or intensity of extreme events have already been detected. Third, climate model experiments consistently predict that continued global warming is likely to cause emergence of unprecedented extreme events.

#### Project 3.4: Understanding adaptation in climate impacts analyses 
**Investigators**: Lobell (lead)

One of the most difficult challenges in modeling climate impacts using any methodology is projecting the adaptation of the impacted sectors to changing climate. Technical, institutional and management changes are occurring continuously in the impacted sectors and those trends are usually included in projections of baseline productivity trends in IAMs that are input to impacts assessments and treated as adaptation in process models of climate impacts. Thus, there is a risk of double counting technological, management, and or institutional changes when examining climate change impact projections, and this risk can only be reduced if one understands at a more detailed level: (i) the drivers of sectoral activity and productivity levels in the IAMs and (ii) the drivers of adaptation benefits in process model studies of climate impacts in those sectors.


### Program Element IV
<div class="subheader-3">Creating a better organized multi-sectoral/multi-regional/multi-model community of practice by promoting systematic engagement between the IAM, IAV, and ESM communities, advancing team-based methodological developments and integrated modeling experiments in IAM-IAV research</div>
<hr>

#### Project 4.1: Planned research community engagement activities 
**Investigators**: Fisher-Vanden (co-lead), Weyant (co-lead), Hertel, Keller, Nicholas, Sue Wing 

Our research team includes individuals from a wide array of disciplines and institutional perspectives and is geographically dispersed. On the other hand, the work of the team represents only a small fraction of the integrated assessment and IAV work going on globally. Thus, it is important to create opportunities both for our project team to co-ordinate its work internally by bringing the different research teams within the project together, as well as to provide opportunities for cross fertilization with researchers doing related in other leading IAM and IAV research groups in the U.S. and abroad, as well as important I-IAV user communities. These challenges will be met with a number of different engagement initiatives.
