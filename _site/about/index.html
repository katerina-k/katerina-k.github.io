			<p>The Program for Coupled Human and Earth Systems (PCHES) is a project, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, looking to create a state-of-the-art framework of computational tools that will help to assess the impacts of weather-related variability and change.</p>

<p>Since models are typically operated independently of one another, this project seeks to link a large multidisciplinary team from 10 different institutions in order to integrate multiple existing models to capture important energy-water-land interactions and feedbacks between natural and human systems. Understanding the connections and interactions among the energy, water, and land systems is crucial to achieving a comphrehensive, holistic view fo the entire integrated system.</p>

<h4 id="project-11gridded-modeling-of-the-energy-water-land-nexus">Project 1.1: Gridded modeling of the energy-water-land nexus</h4>
<p><strong>Investigators</strong>: Hertel (lead), Diffenbaugh, Frolking, Lammers, Schlenker, Webster</p>

<p>Project 1.1 focuses on questions related to extreme climate events, their effects on the energy- water-land system, and adaptation options in the contiguous U.S. To address these questions, fine-scale spatial and temporal analysis of the EWL system is necessary in order to capture the frequency, intensity and impacts of extreme climate events, as well as to understand the infrastructure needs for adaptation to these events. Our approach involves coupling fine-scale process models (water balance, power system and agricultural impact models) with a simplified gridded economic model (SIMPLE) of the U.S.</p>

<h4 id="project-12-capturing-governance-institutional-and-system-constraints-related-to-energy-water-land-in-an-integrated-iav-ia-modeling-framework">Project 1.2: Capturing governance, institutional, and system constraints related to energy-water-land in an integrated IAV-IA modeling framework</h4>
<p><strong>Investigators</strong>:  Fisher-Vanden (Lead), Frolking, Lammers, Olmstead, Webster, Wrenn</p>

<p>Project 1.2 focuses on understanding how governance, institutional and system constraints will affect regional economies under alternative climate change futures, and how relaxing these constraints and addressing market failures could alleviate these economic impacts. We will couple fine-scale process models (water balance and power system models) with a sectoral-detailed economic model focused on the Western U.S. and Texas which will act as the coordinating mechanism to facilitate the interlinkages between the fine-scale IAV models, with an emphasis on governance, institutional, and system constraints.</p>

<h4 id="project-13-integrated-assessment-of-climate-change-impact-risk-on-the-food-energy-water-nexus">Project 1.3: Integrated assessment of climate change impact risk on the food-energy-water nexus</h4>
<p><strong>Investigators</strong>: Sue Wing (lead), Mansur</p>

<p>Project 1.3 focuses on assessing, globally, the risks of cascading adverse impacts on the energy-water-land nexus posed by climate change. Addressing questions at this scale requires a different approach than in Projects 1.1 and 1.2 since direct coupling of detailed process models is typically not feasible at this scale. Therefore, we emphasize the building of large scale statistical and process emulators that can be directly incorporated into a global IAM.</p>

<h4 id="project-21-improving-the-quality-and-ease-of-use-of-climate-information">Project 2.1: Improving the quality and ease of use of climate information</h4>
<p><strong>Investigators</strong>: Nicholas (lead), Forest, Keller, Haran, Sriver, Reed</p>

<p>Project 2.1 seeks to address the following questions: i) How skillful are current empirical-statistical downscaling tools in their representation of decision-relevant information (e.g., modes and tails of relevant probability density functions or the spatio-temporal correlation structure) on regional to local scales? (ii) What are the inherent trade-offs between downscaling and emulation strategies (e.g. statistical emulators based on observational data versus mechanistic/process emulators based on model ensembles) for generating climate information for IA and IAV? The project will address these questions through the development, testing, and application of tools and data sets to IAM and IAV analyses.</p>

<h4 id="project-22-how-does-an-improved-sampling-of-known-uncertainties-influence-the-tails-of-climate-projections-on-decision-relevant-spatial-and-temporal-scales">Project 2.2: How does an improved sampling of known uncertainties influence the tails of climate projections on decision-relevant spatial and temporal scales?</h4>
<p><strong>Investigators</strong>: Keller (co-lead), Sriver (co-lead), Forest, Haran, Nicholas, Reed</p>

<p>One key issue relevant for IAM and IAV analysis is that the frequency, duration, and intensity of climate and weather extremes (such as extreme precipitation events, droughts, heat waves, floods, and severe weather outbreaks) are changing (Walsh, et al., 2014). One key scientific question we will address is what are the driving mechanisms and the projected magnitudes of future changes in extremes. Elucidating this question is crucial to developing sound adaptation and risk management strategies, particularly at local to regional scales.</p>

<h4 id="project-23-developing-regional-climate-projection-tools-to-incorporate-high-risk-events-into-decision--tools">Project 2.3: Developing regional climate projection tools to incorporate high risk events into decision- tools</h4>
<p><strong>Investigators</strong>: Forest (lead), Keller, Reed, Sriver, Nicholas</p>

<p>One limitation of current climate emulation methods is that global mean surface temperature is only one of several factors that may be relevant for changes in regional climates. It is well known that sea surface temperatures (both tropical and extra-tropical) drive large-scale teleconnection patterns that influence regional climate on seasonal and inter-annual time-scales. Primary examples are droughts over North America driven by El Nino or La Nina events which provide a tropical-wide forcing of the global climate system. In past work (Li et al. 2012; Li and Forest, 2014; Tsai et al., 2014; Hoffman et al., 2014), we have developed an approach to identify the influence of seasonal SST variability that drives regional climate changes over the US and other parts of the globe. Using methods and climate model outputs developed through this previous work, we will construct teleconnection response functions (i.e. Global Teleconnection Operators or GTOs) to be used as an emulation tool, providing an additive pattern of variability to complement traditional pattern scaling and emulation methods.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="project-31-base-research-program-for-developing-evaluation-tools-for-modeling-frameworks">Project 3.1: Base research program for developing evaluation tools for modeling frameworks</h4>
<p><strong>Investigators</strong>: Weyant (lead), Diffenbaugh, Lobell, Nicholas, Reed, Sue Wing</p>

<p>Standards for model development and evaluation have been developed within a large number of academic disciplines and application communities. Most, but not all, of this work has focused on single models developed within the boundaries of a single discipline without considering uncertainty in a systematic way. We will draw on this broad range of concepts and methods to develop multi-method, multi-disciplinary, multi-scale best modeling and model evaluation practices.</p>

<h4 id="project-32-climate-projections-method-intercomparison-and-model-diagnostics">Project 3.2: Climate projections method intercomparison and model diagnostics</h4>
<p><strong>Investigators</strong>: Reed (co-lead), Keller (co-lead), Fisher-Vanden, Forest, Haran, Mendelsohn, Nicholas, Sriver</p>

<p>Project 3.2 focuses on refining the global sensitivity-based diagnostic tools and link with key IAV / IAM / ESM team leaders to set up a suite of proof of concept analyses to quantify the effects of improving climate projections on risks, vulnerabilities, and impacts and to determine which (interacting) uncertainties matter the most. Major factors shape this integration challenge including computational demands, difficulties in choosing appropriate methods that can distinguish controlling uncertainties, and the difficulty of understanding how to consistently tailor model information in a manner that has relevance to real operational and planning challenges across multi- sector demands and services.</p>

<h4 id="project-33-quantifying-the-influence-of-global-warming-on-unprecedented-extreme-climate-events">Project 3.3: Quantifying the influence of global warming on unprecedented extreme climate events</h4>
<p><strong>Investigators</strong>: Diffenbaugh (lead), Fisher-Vanden, Hartel, Sue Wing, Weyant</p>

<p>Effective climate risk management requires robust quantification of the probability of different kinds of hazards, such as heat waves, droughts, floods, and severe storms. Now that observed global warming has been clearly attributed to human activities, there is considerable interest in the extent to which that warming has influenced the occurrence and severity of individual extreme climate events. This work on projecting extreme climate events has two major elements: (1) testing the extent to which global warming that has already occurred has increased the probability of extreme events, and (2) using a multi-level nested climate model projection scheme to project the extent to which future global warming will increase the probability of extreme climate events.</p>

<h4 id="project-34-understanding-adaptation-in-climate-impacts-analyses">Project 3.4: Understanding adaptation in climate impacts analyses</h4>
<p><strong>Investigators</strong>: Lobell (lead)</p>

<p>One of the most difficult challenges in modeling climate impacts using any methodology is projecting the adaptation of the impacted sectors to changing climate. There is a risk of double counting technological, management, and or institutional changes when examining climate change impact projections, and this risk can only be reduced if one understands at a more detailed level: (i) the drivers of sectoral activity and productivity levels in the IAMs and (ii) the drivers of adaptation benefits in process model studies of climate impacts in those sectors. This project will start by examining this issue using a combination of relevant observational data and the three I-IAV modeling frameworks described in Program Element I of this project to try to understand how the drivers of yield trends and adaptation in the agricultural sector. In assessing agricultural impacts as part of an integrated impacts assessment, a key question is how much adaptation can help to reduce impacts.</p>

<div class="subheader-3">Creating a better organized multi-sectoral/multi-regional/multi-model community of practice by promoting systematic engagement between the IAM, IAV, and ESM communities, advancing team-based methodological developments and integrated modeling experiments in IAM-IAV research</div>

<h4 id="project-41-planned-research-community-engagement-activities">Project 4.1: Planned research community engagement activities</h4>
<p><strong>Investigators</strong>: Fisher-Vanden (co-lead), Weyant (co-lead), Hertel, Keller, Nicholas, Sue Wing</p>

<p>Our research team includes individuals from a wide array of disciplines and institutional perspectives and is geographically dispersed. On the other hand, the work of the team represents only a small fraction of the integrated assessment and IAV work going on globally. Thus, it is important to create opportunities both for our project team to co-ordinate its work internally by bringing the different research teams within the project together, as well as to provide opportunities for cross fertilization with researchers doing related in other leading IAM and IAV research groups in the U.S. and abroad, as well as important I-IAV user communities. These challenges will be met with a number of different engagement initiatives.</p>
