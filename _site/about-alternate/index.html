				<h1>About</h1>

			<p>The goal of this research program is to build a next generation integrated suite of science-driven modeling and analytic capabilities, and a more expanded and connected community of practice, for analyses of the stressors, impacts, adaptations and vulnerabilities of global and regional change, with emphasis in understanding the Energy-Water-Land Nexus and interdependent infrastructures. Although the scope spans many complex facets of data, modeling, and analysis, as well as scales appropriate for integrated impacts and adaptation research, a particular focus of this effort is the development of multi- model, multi-scale capabilities spanning the domain of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs); Impact, Adaptation, and Vulnerability (IAV) models; and Earth System Models (ESMs).</p>

<h3> Program Element I </h3>
<div class="subheader-3"> Developing use-inspired, innovative and adaptive frameworks for multi model, multi-scale reserach and analysis of integrated impacts, adaptations, and vulnerability (I-IAV)</div>
<hr />

<dl> 
  <dt> Project 1.1: Gridded modeling of the energy-water-land nexus</dt>
  <dd> <strong>Investigators:</strong> Hertel (lead), Diffenbaugh, Frolking, Lammers, Schlenker, Webster <br />
  The impacts of changes in climate, including higher temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns, and human
  systems, including water infrastructure and markets, will have important consequences for the energy, water, and
  agricultural systems and markets, and the important interactions and feedbacks between these systems. To
  understand these feedbacks better and to explore the tradeoffs among alternative adaptation strategies we propose
  to connect a group of simulation models, each representing a key component of this system, at a hierarchy of
  spatial and temporal scales.</dd>
  <dt> Project 1.2: Capturing governance, institutional, and system constraints related to energy-water-land in an integrated IAV-IA modeling framework</dt>
  <dd><strong>Investigators:</strong>  Fisher-Vanden (Lead), Frolking, Lammers, Olmstead, Webster, Wrenn <br />
  Often overlooked yet important factors when modeling integrated impacts are governance, institutional, and system constraints. These constraints can lead to situations of maladaptation to climate change-induced impacts such as water shortages or extreme climate events (e.g. extreme temperatures, drought, and floods). Not only is it important to represent these constraints individually in a framework for modeling integrated impacts, it is also critically important to model how these constraints interact to exacerbate an already strained system.</dd>
  <dt> Project 1.3: Integrated assessment of climate change impact risk on the food-energy-water nexus</dt>
  <dd> <strong>Investigators:</strong> Sue Wing (lead), Mansur <br />
  Future climate change will directly impact the energy-water-land (EWL) nexus in several ways, both positive and negative. Changes in the distribution of temperature extremes alter the short-run demands for heating and cooling and the consumption of different fuels, given extant energy infrastructure. In the long run such temperature changes induce changes in that infrastructure itself, via producer and consumer decisions to adjust the stocks of energy using durable HVAC equipment, with further effects on the demand for different fuels, triggering market responses of energy production and prices, and international trade in energy commodities. Changes in precipitation, runoff and river discharge affect surface water availability and water supply-demand balance. Of concern is the adverse effect of increased water scarcity that directly impacts the economic well-being of households and induces costly adjustments and substitution on the part of producers in multiple water-using sectors (especially irrigated agriculture), as well as spurring the depletion of finite and unsustainable groundwater resources. Food production systems are vulnerable to the adverse effects of droughts and extreme heat on crop productivity, which may lead to crop output declines and price increases and accompanying shifts in patterns of crop production and in turn international agricultural trade.</dd>

<h3> Program Element II </h3>
<div class="subheader-3"> Building foundational, modeling integration methods and capabilities with the development of coupling software, emulators, advanced computational and statistical methods, and translational tools</div>
<hr />

<dl>
	<dt> Project 2.1: Improving the quality and ease of use of climate information </dt>
	<dd> <strong>Investigators:</strong> Nicholas (lead), Forest, Keller, Haran, Sriver, Reed <br />
	The current representation of climate projections has made tremendous progress in the recent past, but these methods still face considerable challenges (Figure 1). For example, two largely open questions that we will address in this project (in collaboration with many others working on IAM/IAV analyses) are: (i) How skillful are current empirical-statistical downscaling tools in their representation of decision-relevant information (e.g., modes and tails of relevant probability density functions or the spatio-temporal correlation structure) on regional to local scales? (ii) What are the inherent trade-offs between downscaling and emulation strategies (e.g. statistical emulators based on observational data versus mechanistic/process emulators based on model ensembles) for generating climate information for IA and IAV? </dd>
	<dt> Project 2.2: How does an improved sampling of known uncertainties influence the tails of climate projections on decision-relevant spatial and temporal scales? </dt>
	<dd> <strong>Investigators:</strong> Keller (co-lead), Sriver (co-lead), Forest, Haran, Nicholas, Reed <br />
	One key issue relevant for IAM and IAV analysis is that the frequency, duration, and intensity of climate and weather extremes (such as extreme precipitation events, droughts, heat waves, floods, and severe weather outbreaks) are changing (Walsh, et al., 2014). One key scientific question we will address is what are the driving mechanisms and the projected magnitudes of future changes in extremes. Elucidating this question is crucial to developing sound adaptation and risk management strategies, particularly at local to regional scales. </dd>
	<dt> Project 2.3: Developing regional climate projection tools to incorporate high risk events into decision- tools </dt>
	<dd> <strong>Investigators:</strong> Forest (lead), Keller, Reed, Sriver, Nicholas <br />
	 One limitation of current climate emulation methods is that global mean surface temperature is only one of several factors that may be relevant for changes in regional climates. It is well known that sea surface temperatures (both tropical and extra-tropical) drive large-scale teleconnection patterns that influence regional climate on seasonal and inter-annual time-scales. Primary examples are droughts over North America driven by El Nino or La Nina events which provide a tropical-wide forcing of the global climate system. Previous work (Tsai et al. 2014, Li and Forest 2014) has focused on developing statistical methods to emulate large-scale regional climate variability and change driven by such SST variability. Additionally, large-scale changes in patterns of snow cover, sea ice,and land cover are also known to drive large-scale atmospheric teleconnection responses influencing regional climate. However, the teleconnection characteristics (primarily, spatial and seasonal changes) of these other factors are expected to differ from those for SST-driven teleconnections such as ENSO. Driven by the combined regional and global scale response over the coming century, potentially high risk climate events such as those described above must be included in scenarios where regionally-resolved variability and change is important for careful IAV assessments.</dd>

<h3> Program Element III </h3>
<div class="subheader-3">Establishing best modeling practices, and developing evaluation tools for modeling frameworks via methods comparisons, diagnostics, and integrated uncertainty analyses</div>
<hr />

<dl>
	<dt> Project 3.1: Base research program for developing evaluation tools for modeling frameworks </dt>
	<dd> <strong>Investigators:</strong> Weyant (lead), Diffenbaugh, Lobell, Nicholas, Reed, Sue Wing <br />
	Standards for model development and evaluation have been developed within a number of academic disciplines and application communities from earth sciences (PCMDI, 2016; Taylor, et al., 2012; Eyring, et al., 2015; Stouffer, et al., 2016) to operations research (Gass, 1983 &1993; Gass and Joel, 1987; Naylor and Finger, 1967) to computer science (Banks, et al., 1988; Kleijen, 1999; Kleindorfer and Gaeshan, 1993; Robinson, 2004; Sargent, 1981, 1984 &amp; 2013) to economics (Wood, 1986; Boland, 2014) to ecology (Bachelet, et al., 2008); and from health systems (Denton, 2013) to energy systems (e.g., Hogan, et al., 1981; Weyant, et al., 2004 &amp; 2006) to national security (National Research Council, 2006) to integrated assessment (Hamilton, et al., 2015; Kriegler, et al., 2015a&b; IAMC, 2016). Most, but not all, of this work has focused on single models developed within the boundaries of a single discipline without considering uncertainty in a systematic way. This work has been extremely valuable, but largely fragmented within and, especially, between these disciplines and application areas. Thus, for interdisciplinary IAV and IAM work there is a both a need and an opportunity to draw on this broad range of concepts and methods to develop multi-method, multi-disciplinary, multi-scale best modeling and model evaluation practices.</dd>
	<dt> Project 3.2: Climate projections method intercomparison and model diagnostics </dt>
	<dd> <strong>Investigators:</strong> Reed (co-lead), Keller (co-lead), Fisher-Vanden, Forest, Haran, Mendelsohn, Nicholas, Sriver<br />
	Project 2.1 above proposes to analyze the impacts of improving climate information on climate stressors that have been chosen in collaboration with IAV and IAM experts a priori. This step can address several important questions, but it is silent on the potentially important (interactive) effects of other uncertainties and on the question of which (interacting) uncertainties matter the most (e.g., Butler, et al., 2014; Hadka et al., 2015; Lempert et al., 2012). Addressing these questions poses nontrivial diagnostic challenges. This work on climate model emulation and uncertainty characterization will help researchers improve the climate projections used in the integrated climate change impacts work described in work plan element I which is a major part of the model integration work in Program Element II. At the same time, it will extend and significantly deepen the climate system part of the overall diagnostics and uncertainty characterization program included in Program Element III.</dd>
	<dt> Project 3.3: Quantifying the influence of global warming on unprecedented extreme climate events </dt>
	<dd> <strong>Investigators:</strong> Diffenbaugh (lead), Fisher-Vanden, Hartel, Sue Wing, Weyant<br />
	Effective climate risk management requires robust quantification of the probability of different kinds of hazards, such as heat waves, droughts, floods, and severe storms. Now that observed global warming has been clearly attributed to human activities, there is considerable interest in the extent to which that warming has influenced the occurrence and severity of individual extreme climate events. This interest is motived by a number of lines of evidence. First, extremes are where natural and human systems are often most acutely impacted by the climate system. Second, trends in the frequency and/or intensity of extreme events have already been detected. Third, climate model experiments consistently predict that continued global warming is likely to cause emergence of unprecedented extreme events.</dd>
		<dt> Project 3.4: Understanding adaptation in climate impacts analyses </dt>
	<dd> <strong>Investigators:</strong> Lobell (lead)<br />
	One of the most difficult challenges in modeling climate impacts using any methodology is projecting the adaptation of the impacted sectors to changing climate. Technical, institutional and management changes are occurring continuously in the impacted sectors and those trends are usually included in projections of baseline productivity trends in IAMs that are input to impacts assessments and treated as adaptation in process models of climate impacts. Thus, there is a risk of double counting technological, management, and or institutional changes when examining climate change impact projections, and this risk can only be reduced if one understands at a more detailed level: (i) the drivers of sectoral activity and productivity levels in the IAMs and (ii) the drivers of adaptation benefits in process model studies of climate impacts in those sectors.</dd>
</dl>

<h3> Program Element IV </h3>
<div class="subheader-3">Creating a better organized multi-sectoral/multi-regional/multi-model community of practice by promoting systematic engagement between the IAM, IAV, and ESM communities, advancing team-based methodological developments and integrated modeling experiments in IAM-IAV research</div>
<hr />

<dl>
	<dt> Project 4.1: Planned research community engagement activities </dt>
	<dd> <strong>Investigators:</strong> Fisher-Vanden (co-lead), Weyant (co-lead), Hertel, Keller, Nicholas, Sue Wing <br />
	Our research team includes individuals from a wide array of disciplines and institutional perspectives and is geographically dispersed. On the other hand, the work of the team represents only a small fraction of the integrated assessment and IAV work going on globally. Thus, it is important to create opportunities both for our project team to co-ordinate its work internally by bringing the different research teams within the project together, as well as to provide opportunities for cross fertilization with researchers doing related in other leading IAM and IAV research groups in the U.S. and abroad, as well as important I-IAV user communities. These challenges will be met with a number of different engagement initiatives.</dd>
